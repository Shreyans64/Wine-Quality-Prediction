# Wine-Quality-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine using Machine Learning techniques. The model is trained on physicochemical properties of wine to classify or predict its quality score.

The goal is to analyze features such as acidity, sugar, pH, alcohol content, etc., and build a predictive model that can estimate wine quality accurately.
